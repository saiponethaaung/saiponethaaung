### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sai Pone Tha Aung. My nickname is Apple (Eatable apple. Not Steve Apple).

I am a Fullstack Engineer with over eight years of experience and actively seeking an opportunity to relocate to Canada or Europe.
My main languages are PHP and Node.js. But I am trying to change it to GO because of its attractive feature and functions that I cannot get from PHP and Node.js. Mainly the concurrency, a strict typing system, and compile-time warning.

I am also interested in deno.js. But I restrain myself from learning deno.js to prevent sidetracking from learning GO and Kubernetes.

Currently, I am working on a [teaching platform](https://github.com/Meaple-Education/) for my wife to teach her student from home.
I write the backend with PHP but plan to change it into GO in the future. For the frontend, I use React and Vue for web and flutter for mobile applications.

I use PHP(Laravel) for API prototyping for this project because it's easier and faster compared to other languages and deployment is simply uploaded to the VPS server. No monitor config, auto restart config, reverse proxy, deployment configuration(pm2), etc. I just create vhost in apache and it's functional and API is ready to use. Also, it's cheaper to deploy all my test applications in a single VPS.
