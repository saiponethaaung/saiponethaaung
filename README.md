### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sai Pone Tha Aung. My nickname is Apple (Eatable Apple. Not Steve Apple).

I am a full-stack engineer with over ten years of experience.
My main languages are PHP and Node.js. However, I am trying to change it to GO because of its attractive features and functions that I cannot get from PHP and Node.js. Mainly the concurrency, a strict typing system, and compile-time warning.

I am also interested in deno.js. However, I restrain myself from learning deno.js to prevent sidetracking from learning GO and Kubernetes.
